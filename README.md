## Data Cleaning
- Deleting redundant columns
- Renaming the columns
- Dropping duplicates.
- Cleaning individual columns.
- Remove the NaN values from the dataset

## Expository Data Analysis(EDA) -Demographics
During the exploratory data analysis phase, I thoroughly examined the sales data to address key questions, such as:

### Reviews/Findings
The analysis of the sales data revealed several key insights. Firstly, there is a noticeable upward trend in sales over time indicating potential growth opportunities for the business. Secondly, certain products emerged as consistently top sellers, suggesting areas of focus for marketing and inventory management. Lastly, revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins were examined, providing valuable information for financial planning and performance evaluation.

### Recommendation
Based on the findings, it is recommended that the company invest resources in promoting and optimizing the sales of top-performing products. Additionally, strategies should be implemented to sustain and capitalize on the observed sales growth trend. Moreover, leveraging insights from revenue metrics can aid in making informed decisions to maximize profitability and operational efficiency.

### Limitations
Despite the comprehensive analysis conducted, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations.
The analysis is based solely on the available sales data and does not account for external factors that may influence sales performance, such as market dynamics or competitor actions.Therefore, caution should be exercised in drawing definitive conclusions, and further research may be warranted to validate findings and address any data gaps.
