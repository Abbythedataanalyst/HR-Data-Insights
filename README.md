# Hr-Analysis

## Project Overview
In the context of human resources, our aim is to harness the power of data analysis to fine-tune talent management strategies and boost overall organizational effectiveness.

## Data source
The primary dataset utilized for this analysis is the "HR Data" dataset obtained from the Meriskills datasets file. This file was provided to me as part of a project during my internship.

## Tools used
Power Bi - Transforming Data and Building Visuals

## Data Cleaning
- Deleting redundant columns
- Renaming the columns
- Dropping duplicates.
- Cleaning individual columns.
- Remove the NaN values from the dataset

## Expository Data Analysis(EDA) -Demographics

### Reviews/Findings

- Demographics Analysis:
The analysis aimed to answer questions regarding the workforce's composition and distribution. Key findings include the total employee count, and attrition rates across various demographic factors such as gender, age, education field, marital status, work-life balance, and distance from home. Additionally, insights were gained into the current number of active employees within the dataset.

- Turnover Analysis:
This analysis delved into understanding factors contributing to employee turnover within the organization. Key findings encompass total attrition rates categorized by job role, business travel frequency, and department. Additionally, the average working years of employees and the count of job roles were examined.

### Recommendation

- Talent Retention Strategies:
Based on the turnover analysis, it's recommended to focus on implementing targeted retention strategies for job roles, business travel requirements, and departments with high attrition rates. These strategies could include offering career development opportunities, improving work-life balance initiatives, and enhancing employee engagement programs.

- Recruitment and Succession Planning:
Utilize insights from demographic analysis to inform recruitment efforts and succession planning. Understanding attrition rates by demographic factors can help tailor recruitment strategies to attract candidates with characteristics associated with lower turnover rates. Additionally, identifying high attrition areas can prompt proactive succession planning to mitigate talent gaps.

### Limitations
The analysis does not account for external factors such as industry trends, economic conditions, or competitive landscape, which could influence workforce dynamics and organizational performance. Considering these external factors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of workforce challenges and opportunities.
